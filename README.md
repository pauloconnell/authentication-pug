## Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Challenges

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-advancednode)](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-advancednode)

We will continue on the path of exploring [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) functionality including working with middleware packages in our Express Application.

Authentication is the process or action of verifying the identity of a user or process. Up to this point you have not been able to create an app utilizing this key concept.

The most common and easiest way to use authentication middleware for Node.js is [PassportJS](https://passportjs.org/). It is easy to learn, light-weight, and extremely flexible allowing for many strategies, which we will talk about in later challenges. We will also explore template engines, specifically [PugJS](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), and web sockets, [Socket.io](https://socket.io/). Web sockets allow for real time communication between all your clients and your server. Working on these challenges will involve writing your code on Repl.it using our starter project. After completing each challenge you can copy your public Repl.it url (the homepage of your Repl.it app) into the challenge screen to test it! Optionally, you may choose to write your project on another platform but it must be publicly visible for our testing.

Start this project on Repl.it using this link or clone this repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-advancednode)! If you use Repl.it, remember to save the link to your project somewhere safe.

## Alternative Solutions

Pros/Cons of Alternatives - also can we use 3rd party/open source solution?

Testability, Monitoring and Alerting

detail testing

Cross-Team Impact

negative consequences/security vulnerabilities - cost$$$, support burden?

Open Questions

Known Unknowns

## Detailed Scoping and Timeline (Used by dev team during creation)

how and when each section of project will be done -

-Milestone 4 - Overview of all boards
  on index page, show a list of links to each 'board'
    -create function to access db, and create a list of unique board names with a link to that 'board'
    -create component to house this list and include it on the index page and in Thread.html so it's easily accessable
